# Kiwix-Search-OpenWebui
Search through a Kiwix server with openwebui.

Needs to configure the url endpoint and books to search in valves first. 

Installation of BeautifulSoup4 is required on your hosting server.

PS. OpenWebui has this weird behavior of including tool output twice in prompt, set `Function Calling` to `Native` to avoid this problem and save tokens.
